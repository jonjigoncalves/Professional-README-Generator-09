## Description

The challenge was to create an app that would generate a README file by taking user inputs through the terminal in node and write them to a sampleReadme.md 

  
  

## Development

In order to create the program, i used a combination of activities that we worked on during the week, Espcially activity 20 which added in the creation of the .then outputs. i also need help from chat gpt to output the liscene badges and some markdown sytax. i was able to use the cheat sheet (https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) but different viewers would not show the same preview. lucily Stackedit.io help me see what i was doing was right. The questions array is pretty straight forward; create const called question and assign it to and array of queston object that include the type of question and the message which would be the question being asked.
